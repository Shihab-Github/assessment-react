This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Tech Stack
 - Nextjs
 - Tailwind CSS
 - Shadcn UI

## Installation

First, clone the repository and run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once done, run the following command to start the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I have created two separate routes for the first two tasks. The calculate two number task is located in the `task1` folder and the `Navbar` task is located inside the `task2` folder. The calculator task is added in the main route so it can be seen when you run the app. To see the navigation bar task, simply change the URL to `http://localhost:3000/task2` and it should be there. I have also developed the mobile view navbar. To see that, you can change the viewport to any mobile screen.

For task number 3, since this is an algorithmic question, I have added a file named `twoSum.js` in the project root. In the file, you can see the code solution and if you want to test the solution, you can run `node twoSum.js` on the terminal to see the result. 

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
